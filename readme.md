
Requirements:
Create a program in your choice of language that can calculate the score of a full round of bowling, based on user inputs and the following rules:

If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shots.
If you roll a spare in the first two shots of the 10th frame, you get 1 more shot.
If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.

How to run:
1) Test class `python test_bowling`  
2) Try main file `python main.py`
3) Enter in scores and it will guide you along the way
4) If successful it should output all frames as inputed as well as score.

Improvements:
Refactor code and start testing before coding.
